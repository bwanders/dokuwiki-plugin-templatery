Templatery
==========

A try at a dokuwiki template plugin.

This plugin is different from other template plugins in that it does not modify
the dokuwiki source. Instead, it offers special syntax to handle field
replacements. This allows faster processing at the expense of flexibility.

The lost flexibility can be regained by using custom template handlers.
